# Environment Variable Loading Issue Analysis

## Problem Statement
The PawaPay integration environment variables are not being loaded correctly when using the namespaced `Myzuwa\PawaPay\Support\env()` function, even though they load correctly when using the standalone `test_env_loading.php` script.

## Observed Behavior

### Working Scenario
- **test_env_loading.php** successfully loads environment variables:
  ```
  PAWAPAY_API_TOKEN from file: eyJraWQiOiIxIiwiYWxnIjoiRVMyNTYifQ...
  Available keys: PAWAPAY_ENVIRONMENT, PAWAPAY_API_TOKEN, PAWAPAY_API_URL, ...
  Total keys loaded: 22
  ```

### Non-Working Scenario
- **Autoloader with namespaced function** returns:
  ```
  PAWAPAY_API_TOKEN: NOT_FOUND
  ```

## Root Cause Analysis (ReAct Approach)

### Step 1: Reasoning
The issue appears to be related to how the environment loading function is being called and resolved through the autoloader system.

**Possible causes:**
1. **File path resolution issue**: The `loadEnvFile()` function in `src/Support/env.php` might not be finding the correct `.env` file path when loaded through the autoloader
2. **Static caching issue**: The `$envCache` static variable might be interfering with proper loading
3. **Context/scope issue**: The function might be executing in a different context when loaded through autoloader vs. direct execution
4. **File permission or access issue**: The autoloader might be running in a different security context

### Step 2: Action Taken
1. **Verified file existence and modification**:
   - File path: `C:\xampp\htdocs\pawapay-v2-integration\src\Support\env.php`
   - File modification time: `1758909406` (recent)
   - File size: `2556 bytes`

2. **Regenerated autoloader multiple times**:
   - Used `php composer.phar dump-autoload --optimize`
   - Generated optimized autoload files containing 1349 classes
   - Bootstrap file is correctly loaded (global `env()` function exists)

3. **Tested different approaches**:
   - Direct file execution: ✅ Works
   - Autoloader with global function: ✅ Works
   - Autoloader with namespaced function: ❌ Fails

### Step 3: Observation
The key observation is that the `.env` file loading works perfectly when:
- Executing `test_env_loading.php` directly
- Using the global `env()` function created by `config/bootstrap.php`

But fails when using the namespaced `Myzuwa\PawaPay\Support\env()` function, even though:
- The file exists and is recent
- The autoloader is properly generated
- The bootstrap file loads correctly

### Step 4: Further Reasoning
This suggests the issue is specifically with the `loadEnvFile()` function in `src/Support/env.php` when called through the namespaced autoloader context.

**Most likely cause**: The `__DIR__` magic constant in the `loadEnvFile()` function is resolving to a different path when the file is loaded through the autoloader versus direct execution.

In `src/Support/env.php`:
```php
function loadEnvFile()
{
    $envFile = __DIR__ . '/../../.env';  // This path resolution might be different
    // ...
}
```

When loaded through autoloader, `__DIR__` might resolve to:
- `vendor/composer/../../.env` (incorrect)

When executed directly, `__DIR__` resolves to:
- `src/Support/../../.env` (correct)

## Recommended Solution

### Option 1: Fix Path Resolution (Recommended)
Modify the `loadEnvFile()` function in `src/Support/env.php` to use a more reliable path resolution:

```php
function loadEnvFile()
{
    // Use project root instead of relative path
    $envFile = dirname(__DIR__, 2) . '/.env';
    // Alternative: Use getcwd() or a more robust method
    // ...
}
```

### Option 2: Use Alternative Environment Loading
Consider using a different approach for environment loading that doesn't rely on `__DIR__` magic constants.

### Option 3: Debug the Path Resolution
Add debugging to see exactly what path is being resolved:

```php
function loadEnvFile()
{
    $envFile = __DIR__ . '/../../.env';
    error_log("Attempting to load env file from: " . $envFile);
    error_log("File exists: " . (file_exists($envFile) ? 'YES' : 'NO'));
    // ...
}
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: High - Core functionality (environment loading) is broken
- **Scope**: Affects all PawaPay integration functionality that relies on environment variables
- **Workaround**: Currently using global `env()` function as a temporary workaround

## Next Steps
1. Implement the recommended path resolution fix
2. Test the fix with both direct execution and autoloader
3. Verify all environment variables load correctly
4. Remove any temporary workarounds once fixed

## Alternative Troubleshooting Methods

### Method 1: Direct Token Insertion
As a test, we will try to bypass the `env()` function and directly insert the API token into the code where it is used. This will help confirm if the rest of the API connection logic is working correctly, isolating the problem to the environment loading mechanism.

### Method 2: Using a Different Environment Loading Library
If the custom `env()` function continues to fail, we can try integrating a well-tested, third-party environment loading library like `vlucas/phpdotenv`. This would replace the custom implementation and likely resolve any path or context issues.

### Method 3: Server Configuration Check
We will investigate the server's configuration (PHP-FPM, Apache, etc.) to see if there are any settings that might be preventing environment variables from being properly read by the PHP process when invoked through the autoloader.
