Modesy Payment System Analysis & Test Scenarios
 
Note: This assumes you are the testing architect engineer, you need to varify the sdk fully. 

Based on the Modesy documentation, I've analyzed the comprehensive payment and transaction architecture. The system processes multiple transaction types through a centralized handler with sophisticated commission management and multi-currency support.

Here are the key insights for your PawaPay integration testing:

Critical Transaction Processing Points
Core Transaction Types:

Product Sales - Primary revenue with vendor commissions
Service Payments - Membership plans, promotions, wallet deposits
Financial Operations - Refunds, payouts, affiliate commissions
Essential Architecture Components:

Centralized handlePayment() function processes all completed transactions
Hierarchical commission system (Product → Vendor → Category → Global)
Multi-vendor cart support with individual commission rates
Comprehensive checkout session management
Test Simulation Recommendations
For your PawaPay SDK testing, focus on these scenarios:

High Priority Tests:

Multi-vendor transactions with different commission rates
Wallet deposit flows for user account top-ups
Membership subscription payments for vendor plans
Featured product promotion fees
Edge cases - amount mismatches, currency differences, duplicate payments
Critical Integration Points:

Webhook signature verification and payload processing
CSRF bypass configuration for webhook endpoints
Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
Mobile money USSD flow support
Technical Implementation: Your PawaPay integration will need a view file (_pawapay.php), controller methods for completion/webhook handling, and proper database configuration with the gateway credentials.

The analysis shows Modesy's payment system is highly sophisticated with real-time commission calculations, debt tracking for COD payments, and comprehensive audit trails. This requires thorough testing of concurrent transactions, state synchronization, and error recovery mechanisms.

# Modesy Payment System Analysis & Test Scenarios

## Core Payment Architecture

### 1. Payment Processing Flow
Modesy employs a **centralized payment handler** (`handlePayment()`) that orchestrates all payment completion processes:

```
Payment Gateway → Verification → Transaction Object → handlePayment() → Order Creation
```

### 2. Transaction Types Processed

#### A. Product Transactions (Main Revenue)
- **Marketplace Products**: Physical/digital items sold by vendors
- **Classified Ads**: Listing-based products (optional pricing)
- **Digital Downloads**: Software, media files, license keys
- **Product Variants**: SKU-based variations with individual pricing

#### B. Service Payments (Platform Revenue)
- **Membership Plans**: Vendor subscription packages
- **Featured Product Promotions**: Daily/monthly featured listing fees
- **Wallet Deposits**: User account top-ups
- **Commission Collections**: Platform fees from sales

#### C. Financial Operations
- **Refund Processing**: Buyer-initiated returns
- **Payout Requests**: Vendor earnings withdrawals
- **Commission Debt**: COD commission management
- **Affiliate Earnings**: Referral-based commissions

## Transaction Processing Components

### 1. Core Transaction Object Structure
```php
$transaction = (object)[
    'payment_id'     => 'unique_gateway_transaction_id',
    'status_text'    => 'gateway_status_message',
    'status'         => 1, // 1 = success, 0 = failed
    'payment_method' => 'gateway_name_key'
];
```

### 2. Checkout Object Properties
```php
$checkout->grand_total        // Total payment amount
$checkout->currency_code      // Payment currency
$checkout->checkout_token     // Session identifier
$checkout->status            // Payment status tracking
```

### 3. Commission System Architecture
- **Hierarchical Commission**: Product → Vendor → Category → Global
- **Real-time Calculation**: Dynamic commission rates
- **Multi-currency Support**: Per-currency commission handling
- **Commission Debt Tracking**: COD payment management

## Payment Gateway Integration Points

### 1. Database Configuration
```sql
payment_gateways table:
- name_key: Unique identifier (e.g., 'pawapay')
- public_key: Gateway public credentials
- secret_key: Gateway private credentials
- webhook_secret: Webhook verification key
- environment: 'sandbox' | 'production'
- status: 1 (active) | 0 (inactive)
```

### 2. Required Implementation Files
- **View**: `app/Views/cart/payment_methods/_pawapay.php`
- **Controller**: Methods in `CheckoutController.php`
- **Routes**: GET/POST endpoints for completion/webhooks
- **CSRF Exception**: Webhook route must bypass CSRF protection

### 3. Payment Verification Requirements
- **Amount Validation**: Exact match with checkout total
- **Currency Validation**: Match checkout currency
- **Token Verification**: Valid checkout session
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Check existing order status

## Test Scenarios for PawaPay Integration

  "checkout": {
    "grand_total": 100.00,
    "currency_code": "USD",
    "destination": "user_wallet"
  }
}
```

    "promotion_type": "featured_daily",
    "product_id": "12345"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling Test Cases

### 1. Amount Mismatch Scenarios
- **Overpayment**: Gateway reports higher amount than expected
- **Underpayment**: Gateway reports lower amount than expected
- **Currency Mismatch**: Different currency than expected

### 2. Duplicate Payment Prevention
- **Double Submission**: Same checkout token processed twice
- **Webhook Replay**: Multiple webhook deliveries
- **Race Conditions**: Simultaneous completion and webhook

### 3. Network Failure Scenarios
- **Partial Failures**: Payment successful but webhook failed
- **Timeout Scenarios**: Long-running payment verification
- **Retry Logic**: Failed webhook processing

## Integration Architecture Recommendations

### 1. Payment Flow Design
```
User Checkout → PawaPay SDK → Payment Processing → Webhook → Order Completion
     ↓              ↓                ↓               ↓            ↓
  Session          Auth           Verify          Update       Fulfill
  Creation       Request        Payment          Status       Order
```

### 2. State Management
- **Checkout Sessions**: Temporary payment state tracking
- **Transaction Log**: Comprehensive audit trail
- **Status Synchronization**: Real-time status updates
- **Error Recovery**: Failed payment handling

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- **Sandbox Environment**: Isolated testing environment
- **Mock Responses**: Simulated gateway responses
- **Load Testing**: High-volume transaction simulation
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Comprehensive error scenarios

## PawaPay-Specific Considerations

### 1. Mobile Money Integration
- **USSD Flow Support**: Mobile money payment flows
- **Carrier Integration**: Multiple mobile network support
- **Currency Localization**: Local currency handling
- **Regional Compliance**: Local payment regulations

### 2. Webhook Implementation
```php
public function handlePawaPayWebhook()
{
    try {
        // 1. Verify webhook signature
        $config = getPaymentGateway('pawapay');
        $payload = $this->request->getJSON(true);
        
        // 2. Extract transaction details
        $paymentId = $payload['transaction_id'];
        $status = $payload['status'];
        $amount = $payload['amount'];
        
        // 3. Find checkout session
        $checkoutToken = $payload['checkout_token'];
        $checkout = $this->checkoutModel->getCheckoutByToken($checkoutToken);
        
        // 4. Verify payment details
        if (!$this->verifyPaymentAmount($checkout, $payload)) {
            throw new \Exception('Amount mismatch');
        }
        
        // 5. Create transaction object
        $transaction = (object)[
            'payment_id' => $paymentId,
            'status_text' => $status,
            'status' => ($status === 'completed') ? 1 : 0,
            'payment_method' => 'pawapay'
        ];
        
        // 6. Process payment
        $result = $this->handlePayment($checkout, $transaction, true);
        
        return $this->response->setStatusCode(200, 'OK');
        
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        log_message('error', 'PawaPay Webhook Error: ' . $e->getMessage());
        return $this->response->setStatusCode(500, 'Internal Server Error');
    }
}
```
