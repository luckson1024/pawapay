Am developing pawapay into myzuwa.com which uses modesy script. do a deep analysis of what transactions and payments processed according to modesy documentation. i have developed the sdk, hence i need to develop a simulation to test the sdk on various payment processing including wallets

I'll analyze the Modesy payment system architecture and transaction flows to help you build comprehensive testing scenarios for your PawaPay integration with myzuwa.com.




The framework addresses critical integration requirements:
Key Testing Components:

Transaction Simulator: Tests all Modesy payment flows (marketplace sales, service payments, wallet operations)
Webhook Testing Suite: Validates PawaPay callback processing with signature verification
Error Scenario Generator: Simulates failures like insufficient funds, network timeouts, invalid MSISDNs
Security Testing Tools: Authentication, data protection, and penetration testing

Critical PawaPay Integration Points:

Callback URL configuration and IP whitelisting Using the API - pawaPay Merchant API
API token management and request signing API Token - pawaPay Dashboard docs
Sandbox environment testing with special phone numbers Testing the integration - pawaPay Merchant API
Idempotent webhook endpoints with proper authentication bypass Implementation considerations - pawaPay Merchant API

Comprehensive Test Scenarios:

Multi-vendor cart processing with different commission rates
Hierarchical commission calculations across product/vendor/category levels
Mobile money correspondent routing (MTN, Airtel, M-Pesa, etc.)
Asynchronous payment confirmation handling
Currency conversion and formatting validation

The prompt includes specific technical implementations, realistic test data structures, performance benchmarks, and an 8-week development timeline. This framework will ensure your PawaPay SDK seamlessly integrates with Modesy's payment processing architecture while maintaining security and reliability standards.
The testing dashboard will provide real-time monitoring, webhook payload inspection, error pattern analysis, and automated validation of all integration points between your SDK and Modesy's handlePayment() system.
