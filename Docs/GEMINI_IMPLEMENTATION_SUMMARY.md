# Gemini Integration - Task Summary

This document summarizes the tasks carried out to integrate Google's Gemini AI models into the Modesy AI Writer.

## 1. Analysis of Existing OpenAI Integration

-   **File Analyzed**: `modesy-2.6/app/Config/AIWriter.php`
-   **Objective**: To understand the existing architecture for the OpenAI integration, including configuration, API request handling, and response processing.
-   **Outcome**: A clear understanding of the required changes to support a dual-provider system.

## 2. Core Gemini Integration (Backend)

-   **File Modified**: `modesy-2.6/app/Config/AIWriter.php`
-   **Changes Made**:
    -   Added a new `$aiProvider` property to switch between `openai` and `gemini`.
    -   Added the Gemini API URL (`$geminiApiUrl`).
    -   Updated the `$models` array to include Gemini models (`gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`).
    -   Refactored the `generateText` method to act as a dispatcher, calling either `generateTextOpenAI` or `generateTextGemini` based on the selected provider.
    -   Created a new `generateTextGemini` private method to handle API requests to the Gemini API.
    -   Replaced the `match` expression in `generateAIPrompt` with a `switch` statement for broader PHP version compatibility.

## 3. UI Integration for Admin Panel

-   **File Analyzed**: `modesy-2.6/app/Views/admin/settings/preferences.php`
-   **Objective**: To identify the location of the AI Writer settings UI and plan for the inclusion of Gemini settings.
-   **File Modified**: `modesy-2.6/app/Views/admin/settings/preferences.php`
-   **Changes Made**:
    -   Updated the section title to "AI Content Creator (OpenAI & Gemini)".
    -   Added a dropdown menu to select the `ai_provider` (OpenAI or Gemini).
    -   Implemented conditional input fields for the OpenAI and Gemini API keys, which are displayed based on the selected provider.
    -   Added JavaScript to toggle the visibility of the API key fields.

## 4. Backend Update for UI Changes

-   **File Analyzed**: `modesy-2.6/app/Controllers/AdminController.php` and `modesy-2.6/app/Models/SettingsModel.php`
-   **Objective**: To enable the saving of the new Gemini settings from the admin panel.
-   **File Modified**: `modesy-2.6/app/Models/SettingsModel.php`
-   **Changes Made**:
    -   Updated the `updateAIWriterSettings` method to save the `ai_provider` and `gemini_api_key` to the database. The `api_key` field was repurposed for the OpenAI key.
-   **File Verified**: `modesy-2.6/app/Controllers/AdminController.php`
-   **Outcome**: No changes were needed in the controller as it already called the updated model method.

## 5. Documentation

-   **`Docs/gemini_integration_guide.md`**: Created a comprehensive guide detailing the backend integration of the Gemini API.
-   **`Docs/gemini_ui_integration_plan.md`**: Created a plan outlining the necessary changes to the user interface to support Gemini.
-   **`Docs/GEMINI_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`**: This document, summarizing all completed tasks.
