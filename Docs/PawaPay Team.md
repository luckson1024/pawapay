"Welcome to the team! You're joining at an exciting time as we integrate a critical new feature into Myzuwa.com: the PawaPay mobile money gateway. We've already completed the initial research and API testing in a controlled environment. Your role will be to help us integrate this proven code into our main application.
Here’s a breakdown of our plan and how we'll be achieving our results at each stage.
The Goal: What Are We Building?
Our primary goal is to allow Myzuwa.com customers to pay for their orders using mobile money (like MTN, Airtel, etc.) and to enable us to pay our sellers for their sales. We are building a complete, two-way payment system.
Our Core Strategy: How We Ensure Success
We're following a strict, professional methodology to ensure this integration is secure, stable, and bug-free.
Backend First, Security Always: All communication with the PawaPay API will be handled by our PHP backend. We will never expose our secret API keys to the user's browser. JavaScript will only be used to receive instructions from our server (like "redirect the user now").
Phased Development: We won't try to build everything at once. The plan is broken down into logical phases. We build one piece of the puzzle, test it until it's perfect, and only then do we move to the next.
Test at Every Step: Each phase ends with a specific, testable outcome. We don't proceed until we have proven that the current phase is working 100%.
The Plan: Our Step-by-Step Journey
Here’s how we're breaking down the work, as detailed in our PLAN.md file.
Phase 0: Preparation - "Laying the Foundation"
What We're Doing: Before we write a single line of integration code, we're preparing the application. This involves creating a dedicated Git branch, setting up the new PawaPay.php library file, and adding a new pending_payments table to our database.
How We Achieve Results: This phase is all about setup. Success is measured by having a clean, prepared environment. The phase is complete when our Git branch is ready, the empty files are in place, and the new database table exists.
Phase 1: Payment Initiation - "The Customer's Journey Begins"
What We're Doing: This is where we connect the "Pay with PawaPay" button on our checkout page to our backend. We will copy our tested PawaPay.php library and the pawapayPaymentPost() function into the main CartController. This code's job is to talk to PawaPay and get a secure payment link.
How We Achieve Results: We will test this by going to the checkout page on our development server. We'll click the pay button and enter a test phone number.
The result is a successful redirect. The user's browser should be sent to the official PawaPay sandbox page to complete the payment.
Simultaneously, we will check our new pending_payments database table. A new row should appear, acting as a "waiting room" for this transaction.
Phase 2: The Webhook - "Automating the Confirmation"
What We're Doing: This is the most critical part. A payment can take a few seconds to be confirmed. We can't make the user wait on the screen. Instead, PawaPay's server sends a notification (a "webhook") to our server once the payment is complete. We will build the controller (WebhookController.php) that listens for this notification.
How We Achieve Results: We will use a tool called Ngrok to expose our local server to the internet. We'll configure this public URL in the PawaPay dashboard. Then, we'll run a full payment test.
The result is a fully automated status update. We will watch our pending_payments table. When the webhook arrives, the record for our transaction should be deleted, and the main orders table for that order should be automatically updated to "Paid". No manual intervention required. This proves the entire payment loop is closed.
Phase 3: Payouts & Go-Live - "Marketplace Features & Final Polish"
What We're Doing: Now that we can receive money, we need to be able to send it. We'll use the same phased approach to build the Payouts feature for paying our sellers. This involves adding the initiatePayout method to our library and creating a secure interface in the admin panel.
How We Achieve Results: We'll test this from the admin panel. An admin will click "Pay Seller," and we'll verify that a Payout is created in the PawaPay dashboard. We will then check our webhook log to confirm we receive the PAYOUT_COMPLETED notification. After thorough testing of all features on a staging server, we will follow a strict checklist to deploy to production.
